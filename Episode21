She wanted to watch an anime with Tohru 
Kisa absolutely adores that girl, I've never seen her so happy. 

You are right to fear the incredible power
taking out(extract, remove, pull, pull out, ) his stress on other people 
I guess even bad guys can have problems, I never thought of it like that
Yuki: I think the people with really problems are the ones who produced this anime

I see yuki is being cold as usual
Yuki: And as usual, you're being an idiot.

(Back from school)Well, there's the bell.. Gotta run.
-- Ahh, off to work, huh?     See you tomorrow Tohru.
(too early) Oh, I'm early. I guess I didn't need to be in such a rush...

How the heck is going on 
 
Dumb 
 
That's mean 
 
Lamb 


What you've ever talk about is that .. and the video, you couldn't wait to run off and watch it with her
-- But that's not what you said when you gave it to me. You should have just ...told me.

Kyo:How the hell is going on?
Kyo, pan attention. Come on, hiro's jealous of Tohru. 
And for a sixth-grader, that sort of thing can be pretty hard to handle...He needed to vent.09:00 

(apology to sissy)She is right, Hiro, Tohru's late to work now because of you
No matter what, I'm glad to have met a new menber of the zodiac,
And Hiro seems like such a smart boy, but he's still so young and all(definitely)
NoÔºÅ I won't forgive him, even if he apologizes. He's gonna have to be punished, and that's that.
I can hug you. Kyo: Stupid, how is that a punishment?(learn) 
--Hiro's not gonna forget this for a long, long time. 
Tohru:Let's start over(Make a new beginning), okay? It's wonderful to meet.. Hiro.

oh right, I definitely will
